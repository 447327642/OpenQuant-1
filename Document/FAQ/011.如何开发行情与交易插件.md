# How to develop a custom market data or execution provider 

You can find examples of custom market data and execution providers in OpenQuant installation folder 
(windows Start menu SmartQuant Ltd -> OpenQuant -> Samples -> Sample Providers). These examples 
include full source code for MBT, OEC and TT FIX providers that can be compiled under MSVS 2005. You 
can use this code as a pattern to develop interfaces to brokers and market data providers not 
supported out of the box.  
 
Once you develop a new provider and compile it as dll in MSVS, you can add this new provider to 
OpenQuant via main menu -> Tools -> Options -> Configuration -> Providers -> User -> Add.
