# How to access position of a different instrument 

A Strategy has a reference to Portfolio object, which you can use to access Position of any instrument 
using Portfolio.Positions list of portfolio position.  
<pre>
if (Portfolio.Positions[instrument] != null)  
{
  double qty = Portfolio.Positions[Instrument].Qty;  

  ...
}
</pre>
You can also use Portfolio.HasPosition(instrument) to simplify this code.
