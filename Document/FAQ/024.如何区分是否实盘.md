# How a strategy can understrand if it is running live? 

You can use Strategy.Mode property to understand if your strategy code is running in live, paper 
trading or simulation mode. This way you can turn off certain functionality (for example heavy 
debugging) if you are running in the simulation mode.  
<pre>
public override void OnBar(Bar bar)
{
    if (Mode != StrategyMode.Simulation)
      Console.WriteLine("Close = " + bar.Close);
}
</pre>
